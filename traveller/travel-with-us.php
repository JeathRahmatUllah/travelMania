           The weather in Bangladesh is very nice and makes it a favorable destination for tourists from around the world. Bangladesh is at sea level of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra and the Ganges River delta. This delta is formed by the convergence of the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers and their tributaries.
